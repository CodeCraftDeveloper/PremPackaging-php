                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">What are Peel and Seal Bags?</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Peel and seal bags are self-adhesive pouches that
                                            feature a built-in sealing strip. Simply peel off the protective layer and
                                            press the flap to seal the bag. No need for additional adhesives or tapes.
                                            These bags offer tamper-evident, resealable protection and are perfect for
                                            modern packaging needs.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">Key Benefits of Peel and Seal Bags</h4>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">1. Tamper-Evident Protection</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Security is a priority, especially in e-commerce. These

                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">2. Resealable Convenience</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Once opened, these bags can be resealed, making them
                                            perfect for items that need to be returned or stored again. This adds value
                                            and user-friendliness to your product packaging.</p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">3. Fast & Easy to Use</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">No equipment or heat sealing needed. These pouches are
                                            ideal for businesses looking to streamline their packaging process and
                                            reduce labour time.</p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">4. Professional Look</h4>
