                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">1. Eco-Friendly & Sustainable</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">One of the biggest benefits of PackPro™ Honeycomb food
                                            wrapping paper is its eco-friendliness. Made using biodegradable materials,
                                            this wrapping solution reduces plastic waste and supports sustainable
                                            business practices. As sustainability becomes a priority for consumers and
                                            brands alike, using honeycomb paper is a conscious and responsible choice.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">2. Superior Breathability</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Unlike conventional plastic wraps, our PackPro™
                                            Honeycomb paper allows the food to breathe, preserving freshness for longer
                                            hours. This makes it perfect for hot snacks, bakery items, sandwiches, or
                                            even artisanal cheese. The breathable structure minimizes condensation,
                                            ensuring your food looks and tastes fresh when unwrapped.</p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">3. High Strength & Durability</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Thanks to its interlocking honeycomb structure, the
                                            paper offers excellent cushioning and tensile strength. It protects delicate
                                            food items during transit, resists tearing, and maintains its form even with
                                            greasy or moist food. Its durability also reduces packaging failures and
                                            food handling issues.</p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">4. Visually Appealing & Customizable</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">First impressions matter. PackPro™ Honeycomb paper is
                                            not just functional—it’s also stylish. Its unique honeycomb design gives
                                            your food packaging a modern and premium look. Plus, it can be easily
                                            customized with your logo, brand colour, or product details, turning every
                                            food parcel into a branding opportunity.</p>
                                        <h4 style="font-weight: 600;">5. Food-Safe & Hygienic</h4>
                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Food hygiene is non-negotiable. Our honeycomb paper is
                                            manufactured using food-grade materials in a hygienic environment. It is
                                            odourless, non-toxic, and compliant with packaging safety standards, making
                                            it ideal for direct food contact.</p>
